# Personal Project Backend  

This is the first NodeJS backend I created, as I came from a .NET background.
I know this is just the basic implementation of ExpressJS + Swagger docs, but this a start.
I plan on using this backend across my personal projects' repositories here on github.

Any recommendations are very much appreciated 🙇
More endpoints will be coming here~
Cheers! 🍻

### Built with:
- ExpressJS
- TypeScript
- Swagger
- NeonDB (PostgreSQL)
